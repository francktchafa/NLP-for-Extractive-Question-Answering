**NLP-for-Extractive-Question-Answering**

This repository presents an extractive question-answering (QA) framework utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques on the bAbI dataset. By leveraging deep learning-based language models, the system learns to extract relevant answers from structured narratives, mimicking human comprehension in context-based QA scenarios. The model is fine-tuned to efficiently retrieve key facts, ensuring robust generalization across diverse tasks within the dataset.
